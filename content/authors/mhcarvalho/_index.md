I am a professor of Biochemistry at the Faculty of Sciences, University of Lisbon and a researcher at the RNA Systems Biology group (Gama & Pinto Lab) within the Gene Expression Regulation unit of the Biosystems and Integrated Sciences Institute (BioISI). My research interests focus on networks of biological molecules that regulate cellular processes. To understand the structure and function of these networks, in health and disease states, we use and develop mathematical and computational methods.
