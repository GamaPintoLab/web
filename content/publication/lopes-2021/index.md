abstract: (Peri)centromeric repetitive sequences and, more specifically, satellite
  DNA (satDNA) sequences, constitute a major human genomic component. SatDNA sequences
  can vary on a large number of features, including nucleotide composition, complexity,
  and abundance. Several satDNA families have been identified and characterized in
  the human genome through time, albeit at different speeds. Human satDNA families
  present a high degree of sub-variability, leading to the definition of various subfamilies
  with different organization and clustered localization. Evolution of satDNA analysis
  has enabled the progressive characterization of satDNA features. Despite recent
  advances in the sequencing of centromeric arrays, comprehensive genomic studies
  to assess their variability are still required to provide accurate and proportional
  representation of satDNA (peri)centromeric/acrocentric short arm sequences. Approaches
  combining multiple techniques have been successfully applied and seem to be the
  path to follow for generating integrated knowledge in the promising field of human
  satDNA biology.
